PaintShop
=========

This is a Scala program which solves the optimal set of paint batches that can be produced for a given set of customer preferences.

Usage
-----

The project was developed using scala 2.12.1 and sbt. There are test files in src/test/resources. For convenience I have included a jar file, run it as follows:

```
scala paintshop_2.12-1.0.jar src/test/resources/example1.txt
```
